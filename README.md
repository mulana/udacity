### Udacity

Container for all mini projects from Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.
Each mini project should have its own folder. Currently it only contains Animal trading cards.

### Running instructions

Each project should have its own README with running instructions in it.
