			<p class="about">White Bengal tigers have pink noses, white-to-creme coloured fur and black, grey or chocolate-coloured stripes. White Bengal tigers eyes are usually blue, but may be green or amber. It is a large and powerful animal that can weigh up to 300kg and reaches more than 3 meters in length. These animals are incredibly rare as their colouration is dependent on a defective, recessive gene that is passed on from their parents. </p>
